            John F. Kennedy was the 35th President of the United States (1961-1963), the youngest man elected to the office. On
            November 22, 1963, when he was hardly past his first thousand days in office, JFK was assassinated in Dallas, Texas,
            becoming also the youngest President to die.

            About the Legend
        </h1>
        <p>
            &#x261B; John F. Kennedy was born into a rich, politically connected Boston family of Irish-Catholics. He and his eight siblings
            enjoyed a privileged childhood of elite private schools, sailboats, servants, and summer homes. During his childhood and
            youth, “Jack” Kennedy suffered frequent serious illnesses. Nevertheless, he strove to make his own way, writing a
            best-selling book while still in college at Harvard University and volunteering for hazardous combat duty in the Pacific
            during World War II. <br> &#x261B; Kennedy's wartime service made him a hero. After a short stint as a journalist, Kennedy entered
            politics, serving in the US House of Representatives from 1947 to 1953 and the US Senate from 1953 to 1961. Kennedy was the youngest person elected US president and the first Roman Catholic to serve in that office. For many
            observers, his presidency came to represent the ascendance of youthful idealism in the aftermath of World War II.<br> &#x261B; The
            promise of this energetic and telegenic leader was not to be fulfilled, as he was assassinated near the end of his third
            year in office. For many Americans, the public murder of President Kennedy remains one of the most traumatic events in
            memory; countless Americans can remember exactly where they were when they heard that President Kennedy had been shot.
            His shocking death stood at the forefront of a period of political and social instability in the country and the world.
